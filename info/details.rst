.. note::

   If your cluster details are not found, verify you have entered the same e-mail address used to register for GTS (your Okta accout e-mail address, not an alias). If you still experience issues, ask for assistance in `#_gtsamer-general <slack://channel?team=T0252CLM8&id=C01N3LRUV9C>`_.

In addition to providing network and credential information, you will also be given a **USER**\ *##* **ID** (ex. USER01, USER02, etc.).

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, you will use this value to label assets (VMs, policies, etc.) created throughout the labs. This value also identifies applications and VMs that have been pre-staged for you in order to more efficiently complete the labs.
