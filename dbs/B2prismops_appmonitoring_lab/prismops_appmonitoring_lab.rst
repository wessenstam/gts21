[BONUS] Application Monitoring with Prism Ultimate
--------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: images/operationstriangle.png

Prism Pro brings smart automation to our customer’s daily IT operations. With Prism Ultimate we expand this smart automation and intelligent learning to the application and services layers. The typical operations workflow is a continuous cycle of monitoring, analyzing and taking action where necessary. Prism Pro mirrors traditional IT Admin's workflows to improve operations efficiency and Prism Ultimate combines that with full-stack visibility. With Prism Ultimate, IT Admins are able to connect insights from application machine data to automate this typical flow using the power of the machine learning engine X-FIT and the X-Play automation engine.

In this lab you will learn how Prism Ultimate can help IT Admins monitor, analyze and automatically act when a SQL Server's performance is impacted. You will also see how you can discover applications running on your cluster with Prism Ultimate.

Lab Setup
+++++++++

#. Open your **Prism Central** and navigate to the **VMs** page. Note down the IP Address of the **PrismOpsLabUtilityServer**. You will need to access this IP Address throughout this lab.

   .. figure:: images/init1.png

#. Open a new tab in the browser, and navigate to http://`<PrismOpsLabUtilityServer_IP_ADDRESS>`/alerts [example http://10.38.17.12/alerts]. It is possible you may need to log into the VM if you are the first one to use it. Just fill out the **Prism Central IP**, **Username** and **Password** and click **Login**.

   .. figure:: images/init2.png

#. Once you have landed on the alerts page, leave the tab open. It will be used in a later portion of this lab.

   .. figure:: images/init2b.png

#. In a separate tab, navigate to http://`<PrismOpsLabUtilityServer_IP_ADDRESS>`/ to complete the lab from [example http://10.38.17.12/]. Use the UI at this URL to complete the lab.

SQL Server Monitoring with Prism Ultimate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prism Ultimate includes the SQL Server monitoring pack which allows IT admin to understand how infrastructure may impact applications and vice versa. This is an agentless solution that gives visibility into databases, queries and SQL metrics and applies the X-FIT behavior learning and anomaly detection capabilities.

#. Go to Integrations from the Prism Central home page

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring0.png

#. Click **Get Started** to start setting up a monitoring integration.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring1.png

#. This is the page where the your configured integrations would show up. Click on **Configure instances**.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring2.png

#. Choose **Microsoft SQL Server** from the dropdown(the other option being vCenter) and click on **Enable** so that the Nutanix collector can start collecting external metrics. In case the SQL Server collector is already enabled, you will not see that option and can skip to the next step.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring3.png

#. Choose your SQL Server Host IP from the dropdown list. This is the IP address of the MSSQL server VM configured for this lab, confirm that it is the right IP address by checking on the VMs page.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring4.png

#. Fill in the rest of the fields with the credentials listed below. The port should be auto-filled with 1433, the standard SQL port. Click on **Test Connection** and then hit **Save** once it is successful.

   - **username: sa**
   - **password: Nutanix/1234**.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring5.png

#. You should see your SQL Server show up under integrations like in the figure below. Click on the Server Name(IP Address) to have a look at what is being collected.

   .. figure:: images/appmonitoring6.png

#. In addition to the summary view, you can look at the databases running on the SQL Server, SQL Specific metrics impacting the server's performance and queries sorted by highest average execution time to provide a better insight into the application.

   .. figure:: images/sqlqueries.png

#. Since the SQL Monitoring has just been setup, it will take time for the metrics to populate for a better view of the charts. The figure below shows an example of how the charts would look once the moniotoring has been running for a while. We can see that in the **CPU Utilization** chart anomalies are picked up on based on machine learned baselines just like we do for VM data.

   .. figure:: images/sqlcharts.png

#. Now we will create an alert policy for the **Buffer Pool Size** and a playbook based on that alert so we can see how we can extend the simplicity of our powerful X-Play automation onto applications as well with Prism Ultimate. Scroll down to the **Buffer Pool Size** metric and click on **Actions** and choose **alert settings**.

   .. figure:: images/bufferalert1.png

#. We will be stressing the SQL Server in a later step using an application called **HammerDB**. The stress will cause the metric to go very high after a delay of a few minutes. We will keep the alert threshold at a fair number so to get the alert policy raised as soon as possible for our example. Set the static threshold for the critical alert at **100mib**. Also change the inteval for how long the conditions should persist before triggering an alert to **0 Minutes** as shown below, so that the alert is triggered immediately with a spike in the metric. Do make sure to change the policy name to **Initials - SQL Server Buffer Pool Size**. Click save and go to playbooks under the Operations tab.

   .. figure:: images/bufferalert2.png

#. For the next part of this lab, if you understand how to set up Playbooks already and wish to do so, you have the option to skip the setup of the next Playbook. Instead follow the steps under the Importing/Exporting Playbooks section below. We recommend reading through the steps to create the Playbook to better understand what it is doing.

#. Now we will create the playbook which we want to execute when this alert policy is triggered. The actions we want to take are running a powershell script on the VM to collect logs and then uploading those logs onto a google drive so we can review what went wrong. Choose **Alert** as the trigger for your playbook and specifiy the alert policy you just created. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay1.png

#. We have to get the VM IP Address so we can use the out of the box **Powershell** action to run our script. So we will need to create a couple of actions first. The first one will be to the lookup the VM IP. Click on **Add Action** and select the **REST API** action. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay2.png

#. We use our Nutanix v3 APIs to collect the VM metrics. Select the **POST** method. You will need to enter the Prism Central credentials that were used to login. Fill in the rest of the fields according to below where **localhost** will be the **Prism Central** IP address. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   - **Method:** POST
   - **URL:** https://localhost:9440/api/nutanix/v3/groups
   - **Request Body:** ``{"entity_type":"ntnxprismops__microsoft_sqlserver__instance","entity_ids": ["{{trigger[0].source_entity_info.uuid}}"],"query_name":"eb:data-1594987537113","grouping_attribute":" ","group_count":3,"group_offset":0,"group_attributes":[],"group_member_count":40,"group_member_offset":0,"group_member_sort_attribute":"active_node_ip","group_member_sort_order":"DESCENDING","group_member_attributes":[{"attribute":"active_node_ip"}]}``
   - **Request Header:** Content-Type:application/json

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay3.png

#. Click add action and select the **String Parse** action so that we can extract the VM IP from the previous action. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay4.png

#. Use the **Parameter** link to choose the **Response Body** from the previous action. Add in the following JSON path and fill in the rest of the fields as shown in the figure below. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   - **JSON Path:** ``$.group_results[0].entity_results[0].data[0].values[0].values[0]``

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay5.png

#. Click **Add Action** to add the next action and select the **IP Address Powershell** action. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   .. figure:: images/sqlplay6.png

#. Use the **Parameters** link to get the parsed string from the previous action i.e. the VM IP for the **IP Address/Hostname** field. Provide the SQL VM credentials listed below. Provide the followng path to script and replace <Name> with your name so you can recognize your log file in the google drive. Make sure to enter only your first name or full name without any spaces in betweeen since the script will read in only one string, example - **firstname_lastname**. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

   - **Username: Administrator**
   - **Password: Nutanix/4u**.
   - **JSON Path:** C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\UploadToGDrive.ps1 -id <Name>

  .. figure:: images/sqlplay7.png

#. Now we'll add the last action for the playbook, Click **Add Action** and select the **Email** action to send an email. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

  .. figure:: images/sqlplay8.png

#. In the email we want to let teh user know that a alert has been raised and a log file has been uploaded to a google drive link that we will provide so they can take a look. Fill in the following fields. **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

      - **Recipient:** - Fill in your email address.
      - **Subject :** - ``X-Play notification for {{trigger[0].alert_entity_info.name}}``
      - **Message:** - ``This is a message from Prism Pro X-Play. Logs have been collected for your SQL server due to a high buffer pool size event and are available for you at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e4hhdCydQ5pjEKMXUoxe0f35-uYshnLZ?usp=sharing``

  .. figure:: images/sqlplay9.png

#. Click **Save & Close** button and save it with a name “*Initials* - High Buffer Pool Size”. **Be sure to enable the ‘Enabled’ toggle.** **If you chose to import the Playbook for this lab instead of creating it, you may skip this step**

  .. figure:: images/sqlplay10.png

#. Now we will trigger the workflow, launch the console for your VM where the SQL Server is running using the credentials listed below. There is a *HammerDB* application already installed on the VM. In order to cause a spike in the metrics we will run a powershell script to create some users on the Server, Go to **Local Disk(C:) > Program Files > HammerDB** and right-click on the file **workload.ps1** and select **Run with Powershell** as shown in the figure below. You could also click on **HammerDB** on the left side as one of the quicklinks.

   - **Username: Administrator**
   - **Password: Nutanix/4u**.

 .. figure:: images/hammerdb.png

#. It may take up to 5 minutes for the metrics to spike on the Server, you can skip to the **Appplication Discovery** section below in the meantime which should take roughly the same amount of time in which the policy is raised and the playbook is executed.

#. You should recieve an email to the email address you put down in the first playbook. It may take up to 5-10 minutes.

  .. figure:: images/sqlemail.png

#. Click on the URL in the email to go to the google drive or go directly to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e4hhdCydQ5pjEKMXUoxe0f35-uYshnLZ?usp=sharing and confirm that the log file has been uploaded.

  .. figure:: images/sqllogfile.png

#. Switch back to the previous tab with the Prism Central console open. Open up the details for the **`Initials` - High Buffer Pool Size** Playbook that you created and click the **Plays** tab towards the top of the view to take a look at the Plays that executed for this playbook. The sections in this view can be expanded to show more details for each item. If there were any errors, they would also be surfaced in this view.

 .. figure:: images/sqlplay11.png


Importing/Exporting Playbooks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

X-Play now has the ability to import and export playbooks across Prism Centrals. In the example below we will show how to import the playbook that is created in the preceding steps. The user will still need to create the alert policies and go through the workflow to trigger the alert as listed in the steps in the previous section. We recommend reading through the steps to create the playbook and understanding them properly.

#. Download the following file which is an export of the playbook you will need. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lyVoKI0Xf0lJgC4k9aAfMTdztWD0fVMT/view?usp=sharing

#. Go to Playbooks page and click on **Import**

 .. figure:: images/import0.png

#. You will need to choose the Binary file that you downloaded as the playbook to import.

 .. figure:: images/import1.png

#. You will see some validation errors since the certain fields such as credentials and URLs will be different for your environment. Click on **Import**, we will resolve these errors in the next step.

 .. figure:: images/import2.png

#. Click on the playbook that has just been imported for you - there will be a time stamp in the playbook name. Once opened the you will see that the actions that have validation errors have been highlighted. Even for actions that have not been highlighted make sure to confirm that the information such as **Passwords**, **URLs** and **IP Addresses** for each of the Actions is correct according to your environment. Click on **Update** to change fields in the playbook. Refer to the playbook creation steps above to confirm these fields.

#. First you will need to make sure the alert policy is correct for your playbook. Click on the trigger and choose the Alert Policy you created for the Buffer Pool Size metric above.

#. Then you will need to change the **Password** in the **REST API** action to lookup the VM IP. Change the **Password** field to your Prism Central password.

 .. figure:: images/import5.png

#. Next you need to change the **Password** in the **IP Address Powershell** action to the SQL VM password - **Nutanix/4u** and the name of the user in path to the script to your name(ABC in the figure below).

 .. figure:: images/import6.png

#. Last, make sure the email address in the **Email** action is updated to your email address.

 .. figure:: images/import7.png

#. Once you have changed these fields click on **Save & Close**. If validation errors are still present, the pop-up will say so. otherwise remember to click **Enable** and add your Initials to the playbook name before clicking **Save**

Application Discovery with Prism Ultimate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prism Ultimate gives the capability to discover applications running on your ESXi cluster to identify applciation to VM dependency and get a view of the full stack.

#. Using the hamburger menu navigate to **Operations > App Discovery**

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery1.png

#. Once on the **App Discovery** page click on **Discover** to start discovering the apps running on your cluster.

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery2.png

#. Discovery will run and give you a summary of the apps discovered and identified. Click on **View App Instances** to view the list. You can run **Discover** periodically by coming to this page to identify new apps.

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery3.png

#. Going through the list of apps, you will see there are some Unidentified apps in the list. Select any of these Unidentified apps and click on **Actions** to setup a policy to identify the app.

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery4.png

#. You can identify this app by the Ports that will be auto-filled by Discovery. Name this app, example **Initials - My Special App** and click on **Save and Apply**.

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery5.png

#. Now you can see the identified app in your list and check that the new identification policy you created has been added to the **Policies** list. Any future apps with these ports will be identified under the same policy.

 .. figure:: images/appdiscovery6.png

#. Delete your policy so that the other users may setup their own. Go back to the apps list and confirm that the app you had idenitified is now **Unknown** again.
